## Map Organization
City boroughs can be color-coded based on different criteria. The base map is colored based on the borough's region, while the map in the picture below is colored according its school district. The map color organization can be changed by the drop-down menu on the left. Future iterations should implement a key to showcase what colors correlate to.
